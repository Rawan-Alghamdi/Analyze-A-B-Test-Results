# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results
This is the fourth project for Data Analyst Nanodegree Program - Udacity

In this project, I analyzed a dataset containing the conversion rates between new and old websites for an e-commerce website. I used the concepts of statistics to perform an A/B test, the goal is to work through the notebook to help the community understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old one or run the experiment longer to make their decision.
